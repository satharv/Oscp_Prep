# OSCP_Prep

Welcome to the OSCP_Prep repository! This repository is dedicated to my preparation for the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) exam. Here, I document my journey through various penetration testing labs and platforms, providing detailed writeups and walkthroughs for different machines.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main subfolders:

### 1. [Hack The Box](./Hack%20The%20Box/)
This folder contains walkthroughs and writeups for machines from the Hack The Box platform. Each machine's writeup includes steps for exploitation, privilege escalation, and any relevant notes or observations.

### 2. [Vulnhub](./Vulnhub/)
In this folder, you'll find detailed walkthroughs for machines from the Vulnhub platform. The writeups cover various aspects of penetration testing, including vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and post-exploitation techniques.

### 3. [Armour](./Armour/)
This section is dedicated to machines and challenges from my institute, Armour. The writeups in this folder reflect the unique training exercises provided by Armour, designed to enhance practical skills in network and web application penetration testing.

## How to Use This Repository

Each folder contains subdirectories named after the machines or challenges. Within these subdirectories, you'll find markdown files with step-by-step guides, commands, and explanations of the techniques used to solve the machine.

Feel free to browse through the writeups and use them as a reference for your own OSCP preparation. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
